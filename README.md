# A-comparative-Analysis-between-Zomato-Swiggy
Zomato and Swiggy data helps customers choose the best food ordering app. Compare companies and let customers decide. Clean, imputed, pre-processed data improve comparability. Profitability gains. Sandbox datasets include cuisine, table reservations, two-person cost, famous dishes, and more. Visualising price, quality, and cuisine helps.
The work consists of analyzing and comparing data from Zomato and Swiggy to help customers choose the best app for ordering food. Based on this, we will compare different elements of the both the companies and let the customer choose the best in different scenarios.It compares different services and settings of both food-delivering platforms such as the Average Cost for 2 in all cities, the Number of Restaurants in different Cities, Types of Cuisines Available, Each Cuisine Served by how many Restaurants, and Most available cuisines. The visualisations such as bar charts, pie charts, density charts, and 3D plots were also produced for depicting the features such as a sum of different ratings, vegetarian lovers, city-wise distribution, and delivery time ranges. The work also implements different machine learning algorithms for determining the pattern and predicting future trends. For eg: SVM was used to classify parameters such as type of cuisine, type of food, and restaurants based on their ratings , Logistic Regression was used to predict the restaurants that users would prefer based on their preferences and this was also used to predict the delivery time and ratings, and KNN  was used to cluster the restaurants which have similar ratings, similar cuisine, similar location, or similar delivery time, which were helpful for the user to select the restaurant. The recommendation system can work based on three criteria i.e either choosing Budget & city or choosing city & area or choosing max delivery time & cuisine. It can also tell the approx budget for the given number of people. 
For Example, City - Chennai, Budget  - 1000, No of Persons - 3, the results show restaurant Rating, cost, Max time Delivery, Cuisine, and address for the city Chennai with a budget between 700 to 1300 INR . A separate analysis was done for Banglore City in order to find the details of maximum and minimum-rated restaurants.

## 4. DATASET


### Zomato Dataset

The collected data has been stored in a csv file . Each restaurant in the dataset is uniquely identified by its Restaurant Id. Every Restaurant contains the following variables:

â€¢ Restaurant Id: Unique id of every restaurant across various cities of the world
â€¢ Restaurant Name: Name of the restaurant
â€¢ Country Code: Country in which restaurant is located
â€¢ City: City in which restaurant is located
â€¢ Address: Address of the restaurant
â€¢ Locality: Location in the city
â€¢ Locality Verbose: Detailed description of the locality
â€¢ Longitude: Longitude coordinate of the restaurant's location
â€¢ Latitude: Latitude coordinate of the restaurant's location
â€¢ Cuisines: Cuisines offered by the restaurant
â€¢ Average Cost for two: Cost for two people in different currencies ðŸ‘«
â€¢ Currency: Currency of the country
â€¢ Has Table booking: yes/no
â€¢ Has Online delivery: yes/ no
â€¢ Is delivering: yes/ no
â€¢ Switch to order menu: yes/no
â€¢ Price range: range of price of food
â€¢ Aggregate Rating: Average rating out of 5
â€¢ Rating color: depending upon the average rating color
â€¢ Rating text: text based on rating of rating
â€¢ Votes: Number of ratings casted by people.



###  Swiggy Dataset

This dataset contains swiggy registered restaurants details of major metropolitan cities of India. In this dataset it contains the swiggy past orders and restaurants in cities such as  
Mumbai Bangalore 
Hyderabad 
Ahmedabad 
Pune 
Surat 
Delhi 
Kolkata 
Chennai 
The Swiggy dataset contains variables such as:

Â·	Restaurant Name

## 5.  ALGORITHM used

Support Vector Machine Algorithm (SVM): It is a supervised algorithm which is used to classify the values in the Swiggy and Zomato dataset. This is used to classify various parameters such as type of cuisine, type of food, restaurants based on their ratings.

Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a supervised algorithm learning. It is used to calculate or predict the probability. This was used to predict the restaurants that user would prefer based on their preferences etc. This was also used to predict the delivery time and ratings.

K Means: K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters from the data available from the Swiggy and Zomato datasets. This was used to cluster the restaurants which have similar ratings, similar cuisine, similar location, or similar delivery time etc. which was helpful for the user to select the restaurant.
