# A-comparative-Analysis-between-Zomato-Swiggy
Zomato and Swiggy data helps customers choose the best food ordering app. Compare companies and let customers decide. Clean, imputed, pre-processed data improve comparability. Profitability gains. Sandbox datasets include cuisine, table reservations, two-person cost, famous dishes, and more. Visualising price, quality, and cuisine helps.
The work consists of analyzing and comparing data from Zomato and Swiggy to help customers choose the best app for ordering food. Based on this, we will compare different elements of the both the companies and let the customer choose the best in different scenarios. The data must first be cleaned, certain values must be imputed (if necessary), and the data must be pre-processed in order to have better comparability. This will assist the organization in analyzing the variables influencing the value of its business. The dataset(s) under consideration for the sandbox contain a wide range of features, such as cuisine type, table reservations, average cost for two people, well-known culinary items, and much more. All these characteristics can assist in predicting a better visualization, assisting customers in selecting the pricing, food quality, and culinary style.

## 5.  ALGORITHM used

Support Vector Machine Algorithm (SVM): It is a supervised algorithm which is used to classify the values in the Swiggy and Zomato dataset. This is used to classify various parameters such as type of cuisine, type of food, restaurants based on their ratings.

Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a supervised algorithm learning. It is used to calculate or predict the probability. This was used to predict the restaurants that user would prefer based on their preferences etc. This was also used to predict the delivery time and ratings.

K Means: K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters from the data available from the Swiggy and Zomato datasets. This was used to cluster the restaurants which have similar ratings, similar cuisine, similar location, or similar delivery time etc. which was helpful for the user to select the restaurant.
